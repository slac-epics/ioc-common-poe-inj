To test snmp via the command line
cd to a directory containing WIENER-CRATE-MIB.txt or make sure it's
already loaded into /usr/share/snmp/mibs

To get a single value:
    snmpget -v2c -M +mibs -c public <pdu_net_name> Sentry3-MIB:outletID.1.1.2

To show all variables on the pdu:
    snmpwalk -v2c -M +mibs -c public <pdu_net_name> Sentry3-MIB:ServerTech

See MIB files for other variables.

For Leviton and Sentry units, factory userid/passwd: admn / admn

Sentry units default to a blank SET community keyword, so chances are
all set commands will fail. Check the Network SNMP settings
on the Sentry PDU's web page (just use it's network name as the URL).
Alternatively, ssh in and issue the command:
    set snmp setcomm private

By default, after any reboot of the PDU, the outletWakeupState is set to
on (3).  This should probably be off (2) or possibly last (1).  turn this
off with a csh script like:
    setenv MIBDIRS /reg/g/pcds/epics/ioc/common/Leviton/R2.3.3/mibs:/usr/share/snmp/mibs:/reg/g/pcds/package/net-snmp-5.7.2/share/snmp/mibs
    set i = 1
    while ($i <= 24) 
	snmpset -v2c -M +mibs -c public power-tst-sentry01 Sentry3-MIB:outletWakeupState.1.1.$i i 2
	@ i = $i + 1
    end

--------------------------------------------------
It should be noted that the 24-port sentry unit is a *lot* different
than the others.  No per outlet load management, for one, and 24-ports
have difficulty with snmp polling (a common problem!).  This IOC (and
only this IOC) has been switched to using an snmpwalk to alleviate the
issue, and the timing for turning on/off outlets has been increased.
